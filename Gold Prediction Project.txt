📌 I. Project Setup & Understanding
Define Objective

Predict which column? (e.g., GLD – Gold Price)

Regression or classification?

Use case (trading, forecasting, hedging)?

Library Imports & Warnings

Import necessary libraries

Set random seeds for reproducibility

Configure warning filters, styling

📊 II. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial Overview

df.head(), df.tail(), df.info(), df.describe()

df.isnull().sum(), check data types, duplicates

Time Features

Convert Date to datetime

Extract features: Year, Month, Day, Weekday

Set as index if modeling time series

Univariate Analysis

Histograms, boxplots, and density plots for all columns

sns.displot(), sns.boxplot(), df.hist()

Bivariate Analysis

Correlation heatmap

Scatterplots (e.g., GLD vs SPX, GLD vs USO)

Rolling Statistics

Use .rolling(window=10).mean() to see trends

Compare raw vs. rolling data

Log/Scaling Transformations

Try np.log() or MinMaxScaler / StandardScaler

Outlier Detection

Z-score, IQR method

Visualize using boxplots

🧼 III. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values

Fill (mean/median/ffill) or drop

Feature Engineering

Lag features (e.g., yesterday’s GLD)

Moving averages (7-day, 30-day)

Ratios (e.g., SPX/GLD)

Encoding Time

Use sin and cos transforms for cyclic features (e.g., months)

Feature Scaling

StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler for models that need it

📈 IV. Visualization
Trend Analysis

Line plots of SPX, GLD, etc.

Overlay plots (GLD vs USO on same chart)

Correlation Over Time

Rolling correlation between SPX and GLD

Pairplot

Use sns.pairplot() for multivariate view

🔍 V. Modeling
Train-Test Split

Split with train_test_split() or time-based split

Baseline Models

Mean predictor, linear regression

Advanced Models

Random Forest ✅

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Support Vector Regression

MLPRegressor (Neural Net)

ARIMA / Prophet (if doing time series)

Hyperparameter Tuning

Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Cross-Validation

K-Fold or TimeSeriesSplit (if date-based)

🧪 VI. Model Evaluation
Metrics

r2_score, MAE, MSE, RMSE

MAPE if meaningful

Visuals

Line plot: actual vs. predicted

Residual plot

Feature importance (bar plot for tree models)

Error Analysis

When is the model wrong?

Residual analysis: patterns or random?

🚀 VIII. Deployment/Packaging (Optional)
Streamlit or Flask App

Use streamlit to deploy the prediction model

Save Model

Pickle or joblib for the trained model

Interactive Dashboard

Visualize trends with dropdowns and filters

📄 IX. Reporting & Documentation
Jupyter Notebook Cleanup

Clear outputs, add comments

Mark sections clearly

Summary

Highlight findings: most predictive features, performance, business insight

Save Outputs

Save plots, metrics, model files
